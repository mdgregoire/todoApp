You will need to do the following in order to use this:

In the terminal run: npm install
This should install express, body-parser, and pg.

The SQL queries that you need to build a db are included in the database.sql
file in this directory.
Run the 3 create table queries in a db named 'todo'.  If you want to create
some dummy entries you can run the 3 inserts as well.  The inserts are not
needed for the application to function though.
